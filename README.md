## Why I create this app
I had to create app with Java Spring for final project of Java in my school within 2 weeks. 
I thought it is good opportunity to practice making app which has functionallity of posting because I am planning to create some app which have that functionallity!



## How to access this app
-  go to [client (React): firebase](https://tayu-toukou.web.app) and
please free to Sign up (It takes few minutes starting [server (java): Heroku](https://floating-ravine-24176.herokuapp.com/) 
,so please wait first after clicking sign up button)

## the point I felt it was difficult
- not enough time
- connecting mongodb with Java 

## future improvements
- creating page of user who is not signIn
- adding favorite,comment for posttings
- upload image through server(Java) to Cloud Storage such as Google Cloud Storage  
- Get the first dozen posts in timeline (not all  posts of followers in DB ) because it's gonna be heavy.

... and more!
